# Project Roadmap (October 2025 to February 2026)

## Context
This project was executed as an applied robotics practical assignment focused on:

- learning a trajectory with AprilTag-based localization,
- rebuilding map/trajectory references from recorded data,
- relocalizing a mobile robot against a learned path.

Project window:
- **Start:** October 2025
- **End:** February 2026

## Timeline

### October 2025 — Project framing and baseline setup
- Defined practical objective with client-oriented constraints.
- Set up ROS 2 Humble workspace and initial package structure.
- Prepared first AprilTag detection pipeline and camera calibration workflow.

### November 2025 — Data capture and offline pipeline foundations
- Implemented dataset capture flows (bag recording for detections and camera info).
- Implemented first offline map/trajectory extraction scripts.
- Established reproducible output files for trajectory and tag map artifacts.

### December 2025 — Localization robustness and simulation integration
- Improved pose estimation stability and filtering behavior.
- Integrated simulation scenarios for repeatable testing.
- Added comparison/evaluation scripts for trajectory error and heading error.

### January 2026 — Online relocalization and operational workflow
- Implemented online relocalization node against learned trajectory.
- Published operational metrics in real time (distance and heading error).
- Added RViz visualization markers and standard run profiles.

### February 2026 — Consolidation and delivery
- Standardized package organization and documentation in English.
- Finalized real-vs-simulation workflow separation.
- Delivered reference run scripts, reproducible outputs, and scope boundaries.

## Delivered Capability (End State)
- Offline trajectory/map reconstruction from rosbag data.
- Offline trajectory-vs-query relocalization analysis.
- Online relocalization to nearest learned trajectory point.
- RViz visualization of path, nearest point, current pose, and error metrics.

## Out-of-Scope During This Phase
- Global SLAM and full autonomous navigation stack.
- Dynamic obstacle avoidance and long-horizon mission planning.
- Multi-robot coordination.
