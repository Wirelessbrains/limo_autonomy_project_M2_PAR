# limo_autonomy_project_M2_PAR
Autonomous navigation project for the LIMOS robot using ROS2 and AprilTags. First, the robot is guided with a joystick to map the environment and tag positions; then it follows the learned route autonomously; finally, it localizes itself from the nearest tag and continues the path.
